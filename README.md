# Installation

See https://gokrazy.org/quickstart/ first.

Then, add `github.com/gokrazy/syslogd/cmd/gokr-syslogd` to your `gokr-packer`
invocation.

Configure the listening address through a flag:
```shell
mkdir -p flags/github.com/gokrazy/syslogd/cmd/gokr-syslogd
echo '-listen=10.0.0.1:514' > flags/github.com/gokrazy/syslogd/cmd/gokr-syslogd/flags.txt
```

## Usage Examples

To follow logs of a specific host live, install
https://github.com/gokrazy/breakglass for SSH access and use:

```shell
ssh router7 tail -f '/perm/syslogd/scan2drive/*.log'
```

You can also follow *all* logs:

```shell
ssh router7 tail -f '/perm/syslogd/*/*.log'
```

To search through old logs, grep through `*.log` for the last two days:

```shell
ssh router7 grep rror '/perm/syslogd/scan2drive/*.log'
```

â€¦or `zstdgrep` through `*.log.gz` for older logs (not included in busybox
unfortunately):

```shell
sshfs router7:/perm/syslogd /mnt/syslogd
zstdgrep rror /mnt/syslogd/scan2drive/*.log.zst
```
